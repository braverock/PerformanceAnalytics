#' calculate Upside Potential Ratio of upside performance over downside risk
#' 
#' Sortino proposed an improvement on the Sharpe Ratio to better account for
#' skill and excess performance by using only downside semivariance as the
#' measure of risk.  That measure is the \code{\link{SortinoRatio}}. This
#' function, Upside Potential Ratio, was a further improvement, extending the
#' measurement of only upside on the numerator, and only downside of the
#' denominator of the ratio equation.
#' 
#' 
#' Sortino contends that risk should be measured in terms of not meeting the
#' investment goal.  This gives rise to the notion of \dQuote{Minimum
#' Acceptable Return} or MAR.  All of Sortino's proposed measures include the
#' MAR, and are more sensitive to downside or extreme risks than measures that
#' use volatility(standard deviation of returns) as the measure of risk.
#' 
#' Choosing the MAR carefully is very important, especially when comparing
#' disparate investment choices.  If the MAR is too low, it will not adequately
#' capture the risks that concern the investor, and if the MAR is too high, it
#' will unfavorably portray what may otherwise be a sound investment.  When
#' comparing multiple investments, some papers recommend using the risk free
#' rate as the MAR.  Practitioners may wish to choose one MAR for consistency,
#' several standardized MAR values for reporting a range of scenarios, or a MAR
#' customized to the objective of the investor.
#' 
#' \deqn{ UPR=\frac{ \sum^{n}_{t=1} (R_{t} - MAR) }{ \delta_{MAR} } } where
#' \eqn{\delta_{MAR}} is the \code{\link{DownsideDeviation}}.
#' 
#' The numerator in \code{UpsidePotentialRatio} only uses returns that exceed
#' the MAR, and the denominator (in \code{\link{DownsideDeviation}}) only uses
#' returns that fall short of the MAR by default.  Sortino contends that this
#' is a more accurate and balanced protrayal of return potential, wherase
#' \code{\link{SortinoRatio}} can reward managers most at the peak of a cycle,
#' without adequately penalizing them for past mediocre performance.  Others
#' have used the full series, and this is provided as an option by the
#' \code{method} argument.

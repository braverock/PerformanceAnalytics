#' utility functions for single factor (CAPM) CML, SML, and RiskPremium
#' 
#' The Capital Asset Pricing Model, from which the popular
#' \code{\link{SharpeRatio}} is derived, is a theory of market equilibrium.
#' These utility functions provide values for various measures proposed in the
#' CAPM.
#' 
#' At it's core, the CAPM is a single factor linear model.  In light of 
#' the general ustility and wide use of single factor model, all 
#' functions in the CAPM suite will also be available with SFM (single factor model)
#' prefixes.
#' 
#' The CAPM provides a justification for passive or index investing by positing
#' that assets that are not on the efficient frontier will either rise or lower
#' in price until they are on the efficient frontier of the market portfolio.
#' 
#' The CAPM Risk Premium on an investment is the measure of how much the
#' asset's performance differs from the risk free rate.  Negative Risk Premium
#' generally indicates that the investment is a bad investment, and the money
#' should be allocated to the risk free asset or to a different asset with a
#' higher risk premium.
#' 
#' The Capital Market Line relates the excess expected return on an efficient
#' market portfolio to it's Risk.  The slope of the CML is the Sharpe Ratio for
#' the market portfolio. The Security Market line is constructed by calculating
#' the line of Risk Premium over \code{\link{CAPM.beta}}.  For the benchmark
#' asset this will be 1 over the risk premium of the benchmark asset.  The CML
#' also describes the only path allowed by the CAPM to a portfolio that
#' outperforms the efficient frontier: it describes the line of reward/risk
#' that a leveraged portfolio will occupy.  So, according to CAPM, no portfolio
#' constructed of the same assets can lie above the CML.
#' 
#' Probably the most complete criticism of CAPM in actual practice (as opposed
#' to structural or theory critiques) is that it posits a market equilibrium,
#' but is most often used only in a partial equilibrium setting, for example by
#' using the S\&P 500 as the benchmark asset.  A better method of using and
#' testing the CAPM would be to use a general equilibrium model that took
#' global assets from all asset classes into consideration.
#' 
#' Chapter 7 of Ruppert(2004) gives an extensive overview of CAPM, its
#' assumptions and deficiencies.
#' 
#' \code{SFM.RiskPremium} is the premium returned to the investor over the
#' risk free asset
#' 
#' \deqn{\overline{(R_{a}-R_{f})}}{mean(Ra-Rf=0)}
#' 
#' \code{SFM.CML} calculates the expected return of the asset against the
#' benchmark Capital Market Line
#' 
#' \code{SFM.CML.slope} calculates the slope of the Capital Market Line for
#' looking at how a particular asset compares to the CML
#' 
#' \code{SFM.SML.slope} calculates the slope of the Security Market Line for
#' looking at how a particular asset compares to the SML created by the
#' benchmark

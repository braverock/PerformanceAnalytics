#' calculate the Hurst Index
#' The Hurst index can be used to measure whether returns are mean reverting,
#' totally random, or persistent.  
#' 
#' Hurst obtained a dimensionless statistical exponent by dividing the range 
#' by the standard deviation of the observations, 
#' so this approach is commonly referred to as rescaled range (R/S) analysis. 
#' 
#' \deqn{H = log(m)/log(n)} 
#' 
#' where
#' \eqn{m = [max(r_i) - min(r_i)]/sigma_p} and
#' \eqn{n = number of observations}
# 
#' A Hurst index between 0.5 and 1 suggests that the returns are persistent.
#' At 0.5, the index suggests returns are totally random.  Between 0 and 0.5
#' it suggests that the returns are mean reverting.
#' 
#' H.E. Hurst originally developed the Hurst index to help establish optimal
#' water storage along the Nile.  Nile floods are extremely persistent,
#' measuring a Hurst index of 0.9.  Peters (1991) notes that Equity markets 
#' have a Hurst index in excess of 0.5, with typical values of around 0.7.
#' That appears to be anomalous in the context of the mainstream 'rational 
#' behaviour' theories of economics, and suggests existence of a powerful
#' 'long-term memory' causal dependence.  Clarkson (2001) suggests that an
#' 'over-reaction bias' could be expected to generate a powerful 'long-term
#' memory' effect in share prices.

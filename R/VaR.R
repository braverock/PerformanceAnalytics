#' @note The option to \code{invert} the VaR measure should appease both
#' academics and practitioners.  The mathematical definition of VaR as the
#' negative value of a quantile will (usually) produce a positive number.
#' Practitioners will argue that VaR denotes a loss, and should be internally
#' consistent with the quantile (a negative number).  For tables and charts,
#' different preferences may apply for clarity and compactness.  As such, we
#' provide the option, and set the default to TRUE to keep the return
#' consistent with prior versions of PerformanceAnalytics, but make no value
#' judgment on which approach is preferable.
#' 
#' The prototype of the univariate Cornish Fisher VaR function was completed by
#' Prof. Diethelm Wuertz.  All corrections to the calculation and error
#' handling are the fault of Brian Peterson.
#' @section Background
#' 
#' This function provides several estimation methods for
#' the Value at Risk (typically written as VaR) of a return series and the
#' Component VaR of a portfolio. Take care to capitalize VaR in the commonly
#' accepted manner, to avoid confusion with var (variance) and VAR (vector
#' auto-regression).  VaR is an industry standard for measuring downside risk.
#' For a return series, VaR is defined as the high quantile (e.g. ~a 95% or 99%
#' quantile) of the negative value of the returns. This quantile needs to be
#' estimated.  With a sufficiently large data set, you may choose to utilize
#' the empirical quantile calculated using \code{\link{quantile}}.  More
#' efficient estimates of VaR are obtained if a (correct) assumption is made on
#' the return distribution, such as the normal distribution.  If your return
#' series is skewed and/or has excess kurtosis, Cornish-Fisher estimates of VaR
#' can be more appropriate.  For the VaR of a portfolio, it is also of interest
#' to decompose total portfolio VaR into the risk contributions of each of the
#' portfolio components.  For the above mentioned VaR estimators, such a
#' decomposition is possible in a financially meaningful way.
#' 
#' @section Univariate VaR estimation methods
#' 
#' The VaR at a probability level \eqn{p} (e.g. 95\%) is the \eqn{p}-quantile of
#' the negative returns, or equivalently, is the negative value of the
#' \eqn{c=1-p} quantile of the returns. In a set of returns for which
#' sufficently long history exists, the per-period Value at Risk is simply the
#' quantile of the period negative returns :
#'   
#'   \deqn{VaR=q_{.99}}{VaR=quantile(-R,p)}
#' 
#' where  \eqn{q_{.99}} is the 99\% empirical quantile of the negative return series.
#' 
#' This method is also sometimes called \dQuote{historical VaR}, as it is by
#' definition \emph{ex post} analysis of the return distribution, and may be
#' accessed with \code{method="historical"}.
#' 
#' When you don't have a sufficiently long set of returns to use non-parametric
#' or historical VaR, or wish to more closely model an ideal distribution, it is
#' common to us a parmetric estimate based on the distribution. J.P. Morgan's
#' RiskMetrics parametric mean-VaR was published in 1994 and this methodology
#' for estimating parametric mean-VaR has become what most literature generally
#' refers to as \dQuote{VaR} and what we have implemented as \code{\link{VaR}}.
#' See \cite{Return to RiskMetrics: Evolution of a
#' Standard}\url{http://www.riskmetrics.com/publications/techdocs/r2rovv.html}.
#' 
#' 
#' Parametric mean-VaR does a better job of accounting for the tails of the
#' distribution by more precisely estimating shape of the distribution tails of
#' the risk quantile. The most common estimate is a normal (or Gaussian)
#' distribution  \eqn{R\sim N(\mu,\sigma)} for the return series. In this case,
#' estimation of VaR requires the mean return  \eqn{\bar{R}}, the return
#' distribution and the variance of the returns  \eqn{\sigma}. In the most
#' common case, parametric VaR is thus calculated by
#' 
#' \deqn{\sigma=variance(R)}{sigma=var(R)}
#' 
#' \deqn{VaR=-\bar{R} -  \sqrt{\sigma} \cdot z_{c} }{VaR= -mean(R) - sqrt(sigma)*qnorm(c)}
#' 
#' where  \eqn{z_{c}} is the  \eqn{c}-quantile of the standard normal distribution. Represented in \R by \code{qnorm(c)},
#' and may be accessed with \code{method="gaussian"}.
#' 
#' Other forms of parametric mean-VaR estimation utilize a different
#' distribution for the distribution of losses to better account for the
#' possible fat-tailed nature of downside risk. The package \code{VaR} contains
#' methods for simulating and estimating lognormal \code{\link[VaR]{VaR.norm}}
#' and generalized Pareto \code{\link[VaR]{VaR.gpd}} distributions to overcome
#' some of the problems with nonparametric or parametric mean-VaR calculations
#' on a limited sample size or on potentially fat-tailed distributions. There is
#' also a \code{\link[VaR]{VaR.backtest}} function to apply simulation methods
#' to create a more robust estimate of the potential distribution of losses.
#' Less commonly a covariance matrix of multiple risk factors may be applied.
#' 
#' The limitations of mean Value-at-Risk are well covered in the literature.
#' The limitations of traditional mean-VaR are all related to the use of a
#' symetrical distribution function. Use of simulations, resampling, or Pareto
#' distributions all help in making a more accurate prediction, but they are
#' still flawed for assets with significantly non-normal (skewed or kurtotic)
#' distributions. Zangari (1996) and Favre and Galeano(2002) provide a modified
#' VaR calculation that takes the higher moments of non-normal distributions
#' (skewness, kurtosis) into account through the use of a Cornish Fisher
#' expansion, and collapses to standard (traditional) mean-VaR if the return
#' stream follows a standard distribution. This measure is now widely cited and
#' used in the literature, and is usually referred to as \dQuote{Modified VaR}
#' or \dQuote{Modified Cornish-Fisher VaR}. They arrive at their modified VaR
#' calculation in the following manner:
#'   
#' \deqn{z_{cf}=z_{c}+\frac{(z_{c}^{2}-1)S}{6}+\frac{(z_{c}^{3}-3z_{c})K}{24}-\frac{(2z_{c}^{3}-5z_{c})S^{2}}{36}}{
#'     z_cf=z_c+[(z_c^2-1)S]/6+[(z_c^3-3z_c)K]/24-[(2z_c^3-5z_c)S^2]/36}
#' 
#' \deqn{Cornish-Fisher VaR =-\bar{R} - \sqrt(\sigma) \cdot z_{cf}}{VaR= -mean(R) - sqrt(sigma)*z_cf}
#' 
#' where \eqn{S} is the skewness of \eqn{R} and \eqn{K} is the excess kurtosis of \eqn{R}.
#' 
#' Cornish-Fisher VaR collapses to traditional mean-VaR when returns are
#' normally distributed. As such, the \code{\link{VaR}} and \code{\link{VaR}}
#' functions are wrappers for the \code{VaR} function. The Cornish-Fisher
#' expansion also naturally encompasses much of the variability in returns that
#' could be uncovered by more computationally intensive techniques such as
#' resampling or Monte-Carlo simulation.  This is the default method for the
#' \code{VaR} function, and may be accessed by setting \code{method="modified"}.
#' 
#' 
#' Favre and Galeano also utilize modified VaR in a modified Sharpe Ratio as the
#' return/risk measure for their portfolio optimization analysis, see
#' \code{\link{SharpeRatio.modified}} for more information.
#' 
#' @section Component VaR 
#' 
#' By setting \code{portfolio_method="component"} you may calculate the risk
#' contribution of each element of the portfolio.  The return from the function
#' in this case will be a list with three components: the univariate portfolio
#' VaR, the scalar contribution of each component to the portfolio VaR (these
#' will sum to the portfolio VaR), and a percentage risk contribution (which
#' will sum to 100\%).
#' 
#' Both the numerical and percentage component contributions to VaR may contain
#' both positive and negative contributions.  A negative contribution to
#' Component VaR indicates a portfolio risk diversifier.  Increasing the
#' position weight will reduce overall portoflio VaR.
#' 
#' If a weighting vector is not passed in via \code{weights}, the function will
#' assume an equal weighted (neutral) portfolio.
#' 
#' Multiple risk decomposition approaches have been suggested in the literature. 
#' A naive approach is to set the risk contribution equal to the stand-alone risk.
#' This approach is overly simplistic and neglects important diversification
#' effects of the units being exposed differently to the underlying risk
#' factors. An alternative approach is to measure the VaR contribution as the
#' weight of the position in the portfolio times the partial derivative of the
#' portfolio VaR with respect to the component weight. \deqn{C_i \mbox{VaR} =
#' w_i \frac{ \partial \mbox{VaR} }{\partial w_i}.}{C[i]VaR =
#' w[i]*(dVaR/dw[i]).} Because the portfolio VaR is linear in position size, we
#' have that by Euler's theorem the portfolio VaR is the sum of these risk
#' contributions. Gourieroux (2000) shows that for VaR, this mathematical
#' decomposition of portfolio risk has a financial meaning. It equals the
#' negative value of the asset's expected contribution to the portfolio return
#' when the portfolio return equals the negative portfolio VaR:
#' 
#' \deqn{C_i \mbox{VaR} = = -E\left[ w_i r_{i} | r_{p} = - \mbox{VaR}\right]}{C[i]VaR = -E( w[i]r[i]|rp=-VaR ) }
#' 
#' For the decomposition of Gaussian VaR, the estimated mean and covariance
#' matrix are needed. For the decomposition of modified VaR, also estimates of
#' the coskewness and cokurtosis matrices are needed. If \eqn{r} denotes the
#' \eqn{Nx1} return vector and \eqn{mu} is the mean vector, then the \eqn{N
#' \times N^2} co-skewness matrix is \deqn{ m3 = E\left[ (r - \mu)(r - \mu)'
#' \otimes (r - \mu)'\right]}{m3 = E[ (r - mu)(r - mu)' \%x\%  (r - \mu)']} The
#' \eqn{N \times N^3} co-kurtosis matrix is
#' 
#' \deqn{ m_{4} =
#'   E\left[ (r - \mu)(r - \mu)' \otimes (r - \mu)'\otimes (r - \mu)'
#'   \right] }{E[ (r - \mu)(r - \mu)' \%x\% (r - \mu)'\%x\% (r - \mu)']}
#'   
#' where \eqn{\otimes}{\%x\%} stands for the Kronecker product. The matrices can
#' be estimated through the functions \code{skewness.MM} and \code{kurtosis.MM}.
#' More efficient estimators have been proposed by Martellini and Ziemann (2007)
#' and will be implemented in the future.
#' 
#' As discussed among others in Cont, Deguest and Scandolo (2007), it is
#' important that the estimation of the VaR measure is robust to single
#' outliers. This is especially the case for  modified VaR and its
#' decomposition, since they use higher order moments. By default, the portfolio
#' moments are estimated by their sample counterparts. If \code{clean="boudt"}
#' then the \eqn{1-p} most extreme observations are winsorized if they are
#' detected as being outliers. For more information, see Boudt, Peterson and
#' Croux (2008) and \code{\link{Return.clean}}.  If your data consist of returns
#' for highly illiquid assets, then \code{clean="geltner"} may be more
#' appropriate to reduce distortion caused by autocorrelation, see
#' \code{\link{Return.Geltner}} for details.
#' 
#' Epperlein and Smillie (2006) introduced a non-parametric kernel estimator for 
#' component risk contributions, which is available via \code{method="kernel"} 
#' and \code{portfolio_method="component"}.
#' 
#' @section Marginal VaR
#' 
#' Different papers call this different things.  In the Denton and Jayaraman
#' paper referenced here, this calculation is called Incremental VaR. We have
#' chosen the more common usage of calling this difference in VaR's in
#' portfolios without the instrument and with the instrument as the
#' \dQuote{difference at the Margin}, thus the name Marginal VaR. This is
#' incredibly confusing, and hasn't been resolved in the literature at this
#' time.
#' 
#' Simon Keel and David Ardia (2009) attempt to reconcile some of the
#' definitional issues and address some of the shortcomings of this measure in
#' their working paper titled \dQuote{Generalized Marginal Risk}. Hopefully 
#' their improved Marginal Risk measures may be included here in the future.

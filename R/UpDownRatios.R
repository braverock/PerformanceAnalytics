#' calculate metrics on up and down markets for the benchmark asset

#' Calculate metrics on how the asset in R performed in up and down markets,
#' measured by periods when the benchmark asset was up or down.
#' 
#' This is a function designed to calculate several related metrics:
#' 
#' Up (Down) Capture Ratio: this is a measure of an investment's compound
#' return when the benchmark was up (down) divided by the benchmark's compound
#' return when the benchmark was up (down). The greater (lower) the value, the
#' better.
#' 
#' Up (Down) Number Ratio: similarly, this is a measure of the number of
#' periods that the investment was up (down) when the benchmark was up (down),
#' divided by the number of periods that the Benchmark was up (down).
#' 
#' Up (Down) Percentage Ratio: this is a measure of the number of periods that
#' the investment outperformed the benchmark when the benchmark was up (down),
#' divided by the number of periods that the benchmark was up (down). Unlike
#' the prior two metrics, in both cases a higher value is better.

    # DESCRIPTION:
    # This is a function designed to calculate several related metrics:
    #   Up (Down) Capture Ratio: this is a measure of an investment's compound
    #     return when the benchmark was up (down) divided by the benchmark's
    #     compound return when the benchmark was up (down). The greater (lower)
    #     the value, the better.
    #   Up (Down) Numbers Ratio: similarly, this is a measure of the number of
    #     periods that the investment was up (down) when the benchmark was up (down),
    #     divided by the number of periods that the Benchmark was up (down).
    #   Up (Down) Percent Ratio: this is a measure of the number of periods
    #     that the investment outpeRformed the benchmark when the benchmark was
    #     up (down), divided by the number of periods that the benchmark was up (down).
    #     Unlike the prior two metrics, in both cases a higher value is better.

    # Inputs:
    # R: a matrix, data frame, or timeSeries of regular period returns.
    # method: "capture", "number", or "percentage" to indicate which measure
    #     to return.
    # side: "Up" or "Down" statistic.

    # Outputs:
    # A data.table

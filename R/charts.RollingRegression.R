    # DESCRIPTION:
    # A wrapper to create a panel of RollingRegression charts that demonstrates
    # how the attributes change through time.

    # Inputs:
    # Ra: a matrix, data frame, or timeSeries, usually a set of monthly returns.
    #   The first column is assumed to be the returns of interest, the next
    #   columns are assumed to be relevant benchmarks for comparison.
    # Rb: a matrix, data frame, or timeSeries that is a set of returns of the
    #   same scale and periodicity as R.
    # Rf: the risk free rate.  Remember to set this to the same periodicity
    #   as the data being passed in.
    # attribute: Used to select the regression parameter to use in the chart  May
    #   be any of:
    #     Alpha - shows the y-intercept
    #     Beta - shows the slope of the regression line
    #     R-Squared - shows the fit of the regression to the data
    #

    # Outputs:
    # A stack of three related timeseries line charts

    # FUNCTION:

    columns.a = ncol(Ra)
    columns.b = ncol(Rb)

#     if(columns.a > 1 | columns.b > 1)
#         legend.loc = "topleft"
#     else
#         legend.loc = NULL

#    plot.new()

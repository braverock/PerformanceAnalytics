#' clean returns in a time series to to provide more robust risk estimates
#' 
#' A function that provides access to multiple methods for cleaning outliers
#' from return data.
#' 
#' This is a wrapper for offering multiple data cleaning methods for data
#' objects containing returns.
#' 
#' The primary value of data cleaning lies in creating a more robust and stable
#' estimation of the distribution generating the large majority of the return
#' data. The increased robustness and stability of the estimated moments using
#' cleaned data should be used for portfolio construction. If an investor
#' wishes to have a more conservative risk estimate, cleaning may not be
#' indicated for risk monitoring.
#' 
#' In actual practice, it is probably best to back-test the results of both
#' cleaned and uncleaned series to see what works best when forecasting risk
#' with the particular combination of assets under consideration.
#' 
#' In this version, only one method is supported.  See

#' clean extreme observations in a time series to to provide more robust risk
#' estimates
#' 
#' Robustly clean a time series to reduce the magnitude, but not the number or
#' direction, of observations that exceed the \eqn{1-\alpha\%} risk threshold.
#' 
#' Many risk measures are calculated by using the first two (four) moments of
#' the asset or portfolio return distribution. Portfolio moments are extremely
#' sensitive to data spikes, and this sensitivity is only exacerbated in a
#' multivariate context. For this reason, it seems appropriate to consider
#' estimates of the multivariate moments that are robust to return observations
#' that deviate extremely from the Gaussian distribution.
#' 
#' There are two main approaches in defining robust alternatives to estimate
#' the multivariate moments by their sample means (see e.g. Maronna[2006]). One
#' approach is to consider a more robust estimator than the sample means.
#' Another one is to first clean (in a robust way) the data and then take the
#' sample means and moments of the cleaned data.
#' 
#' Our cleaning method follows the second approach. It is designed in such a
#' way that, if we want to estimate downside risk with loss probability
#' \eqn{\alpha}{alpha}, it will never clean observations that belong to the
#' \eqn{1-\alpha}{(1-alpha)} least extreme observations. Suppose we have an
#' \eqn{n}-dimensional vector time series of length \eqn{T}: \eqn{r_1,...,r_T}.
#' We clean this time series in three steps.
#' 
#' \enumerate{ \item \emph{ Ranking the observations in function of their
#' extremeness. }Denote \eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\Sigma} the mean and covariance
#' matrix of the bulk of the data and let \eqn{\lfloor \cdot \rfloor}{floor()}
#' be the operator that takes the integer part of its argument. As a measure of
#' the extremeness of the return observation \eqn{r_t}, we use its squared
#' Mahalanobis distance \eqn{ d^2_t = (r_t-\mu)'\Sigma^{-1}(r_t-\mu)}.  We
#' follow Rousseeuw(1985) by estimating \eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\Sigma} as the mean
#' vector and covariance matrix (corrected to ensure consistency) of the subset
#' of size \eqn{\lfloor (1-\alpha)T\rfloor}{floor((1-\alpha)T)} for which the
#' determinant of the covariance matrix of the elements in that subset is the
#' smallest. These estimates will be robust against the \eqn{\alpha} most
#' extreme returns. Let \eqn{d^2_{(1)},...,d^2_{(T)}} be the ordered sequence
#' of the estimated squared Mahalanobis distances such that \eqn{d^2_{(i)}\leq
#' d^2_{(i+1)}}.
#' 
#' \item \emph{Outlier identification.} Return observations are qualified as
#' outliers if their estimated squared Mahalanobis distance \eqn{d^2_t} is
#' greater than the empirical \eqn{1-\alpha} quantile \eqn{d^2_{(\lfloor
#' (1-\alpha)T \rfloor)}}{floor((1-\alpha)T)} and exceeds a very extreme
#' quantile of the Chi squared distribution function with \eqn{n} degrees of
#' freedom, which is the distribution function of \eqn{d^2_t} when the returns
#' are normally distributed. In this application we take the 99.9\% quantile,
#' denoted \eqn{\chi ^2_{n,0.999}}.
#' 
#' \item \emph{Data cleaning. } Similarly to Khan(2007) we only clean the
#' returns that are identified as outliers in step 2 
#' by replacing these returns \eqn{r_t} with 
#' \deqn{r_t\sqrt{\frac{\max(d^2_{(\lfloor(1-\alpha)T)\rfloor},\chi^2_{n,0.999})}{d^2_t}}}{r_t * sqrt(max(d^2_floor((1-\alpha)T),\chi^2_{n,0.999})/d^2_t)}
#' The cleaned
#' return vector has the same orientation as the original return vector, but
#' its magnitude is smaller. Khan(2007) calls this procedure of limiting the
#' value of \eqn{d^2_t} to a quantile of the \eqn{\chi^2_n} distribution,
#' ``multivariate Winsorization'.
#' 
#' }
#' 
#' Note that the primary value of data cleaning lies in creating a more robust
#' and stable estimation of the distribution describing the large majority of
#' the return data. The increased robustness and stability of the estimated
#' moments utilizing cleaned data should be used for portfolio construction. If
#' a portfolio manager wishes to have a more conservative risk estimate,
#' cleaning may not be indicated for risk monitoring. It is also important to
#' note that the robust method proposed here does not remove data from the
#' series, but only decreases the magnitude of the extreme events. It may also
#' be appropriate in practice to use a cleaning threshold somewhat outside the
#' VaR threshold that the manager wishes to consider. In actual practice, it is
#' probably best to back-test the results of both cleaned and uncleaned series
#' to see what works best with the particular combination of assets under
#' consideration.

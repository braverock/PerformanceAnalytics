    This vignette gives an overview of the Lo Sharpe Ratio which have addressed the issue of IID in the financial time series data.

\section{Background}
The building blocks of the \textbf{Sharpe Ratio} : expected returns and volatilities  are unknown quantities that must be estimated statistically and are,
therefore, subject to \emph{estimation error} . This raises the natural question: How
\emph{accurately} are Sharpe ratios measured? To address this question, Andrew Lo derives explicit expressions for the statistical distribution of the Sharpe ratio using
standard asymptotic theory. 


\section{Lo Sharpe Ratio}
 Given a predefined benchmark Sharpe ratio , the observed Sharpe ratio       can be expressed in terms of autocorrelated coefficients as
 
 \deqn{ \hat{SR} (q) - SR(q)= Normal Distribution(0,V_{GMM}(q)) }
 
The estimator for the Sharpe ratio then follows directly:
\deqn{  \hat{SR} (q) =  \hat{ \eta } (q)  * Sharpe Ratio}
\deqn{  \hat{ \eta } (q)= q/\sqrt{q +  \sum_k^n  \rho  } }
\section{Example}

In an illustrative
empirical example of mutual funds and hedge funds, we find results, similar reported in paper, that the annual Sharpe ratio for a hedge fund can be overstated by as much as \textbf{65} \% because of the presence of \textbf{serial correlation} , and once
this serial correlation is properly taken into account, the rankings of hedge
funds based on \emph{Sharpe ratios} can change dramatically.

We can observe that the fund "\textbf{Emerging Markets}", which has the largest drawdown and serial autocorrelation, has it's Andrew Lo Sharpe ratio , \emph{decrease} most significantly as comapared to other funds.

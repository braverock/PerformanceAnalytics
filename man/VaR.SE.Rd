\arguments{
\item{R}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
asset returns}

\item{p}{confidence level for calculation, default p=.95}

\item{method}{one of "modified","gaussian","historical", "kernel", see
Details.}

\item{clean}{method for data cleaning through \code{\link{Return.clean}}.
Current options are "none", "boudt", or "geltner".}

\item{portfolio_method}{one of "single","component","marginal" defining
whether to do univariate, component, or marginal calc, see Details.}

\item{weights}{portfolio weighting vector, default NULL, see Details}

\item{mu}{If univariate, mu is the mean of the series. Otherwise mu is the
vector of means of the return series , default NULL, , see Details}

\item{sigma}{If univariate, sigma is the variance of the series. Otherwise
sigma is the covariance matrix of the return series , default NULL, see
Details}

\item{m3}{If univariate, m3 is the skewness of the series. Otherwise m3 is
the coskewness matrix of the returns series, default NULL, see Details}

\item{m4}{If univariate, m4 is the excess kurtosis of the series. Otherwise
m4 is the cokurtosis matrix of the return series, default NULL, see Details}

\item{invert}{TRUE/FALSE whether to invert the VaR measure.  see Details.}

\item{se.method}{a character string indicating which method should be used to compute
the standard error of the estimated standard deviation. One of \code{"none"} (default),
\code{"IFiid"}, \code{"IFcor"}, \code{"BOOTiid"}, \code{"BOOTcor"}}

\item{\dots}{any other passthru parameters. This include two types of parameters.
The first type is parameters associated with the risk/performance measure, such as tail
probability for VaR and ES. The second type is the parameters associated with the metohd
used to compute the standard error. See \code{\link{SE.IF.iid}}, \code{\link{SE.IF.cor}},
\code{\link{SE.BOOT.iid}}, \code{\link{SE.BOOT.cor}} for details.}

\description{
Calculates Value-at-Risk(VaR) for univariate, component, and marginal cases
using a variety of analytical methods.
}
\note{
The option to \code{invert} the VaR measure should appease both
academics and practitioners.  The mathematical definition of VaR as the
negative value of a quantile will (usually) produce a positive number.
Practitioners will argue that VaR denotes a loss, and should be internally
consistent with the quantile (a negative number).  For tables and charts,
different preferences may apply for clarity and compactness.  As such, we
provide the option, and set the default to TRUE to keep the return
consistent with prior versions of PerformanceAnalytics, but make no value
judgment on which approach is preferable.

The prototype of the univariate Cornish Fisher VaR function was completed by
Prof. Diethelm Wuertz.  All corrections to the calculation and error
handling are the fault of Brian Peterson.

\section{Background}{
 This function provides several estimation methods for
the Value at Risk (typically written as VaR) of a return series and the
Component VaR of a portfolio. Take care to capitalize VaR in the commonly
accepted manner, to avoid confusion with var (variance) and VAR (vector
auto-regression).  VaR is an industry standard for measuring downside risk.
For a return series, VaR is defined as the high quantile (e.g. ~a 95% or 99%
quantile) of the negative value of the returns. This quantile needs to be
estimated.  With a sufficiently large data set, you may choose to utilize
the empirical quantile calculated using \code{\link{quantile}}.  More
efficient estimates of VaR are obtained if a (correct) assumption is made on
the return distribution, such as the normal distribution.  If your return
series is skewed and/or has excess kurtosis, Cornish-Fisher estimates of VaR
can be more appropriate.  For the VaR of a portfolio, it is also of interest
to decompose total portfolio VaR into the risk contributions of each of the
portfolio components.  For the above mentioned VaR estimators, such a
decomposition is possible in a financially meaningful way.

\examples{

    data(edhec)

    # first do normal VaR calc
    VaR.SE(edhec, p=.95, method="historical")

    # now use Gaussian
    VaR.SE(edhec, p=.95, method="gaussian")

    # now use modified Cornish Fisher calc to take non-normal distribution into account
    VaR.SE(edhec, p=.95, method="modified")

    # now use p=.99
    VaR.SE(edhec, p=.99)
    # or the equivalent alpha=.01
    VaR.SE(edhec, p=.01)

    # now with outliers squished
    VaR.SE(edhec, clean="boudt")

    # add Component VaR for the equal weighted portfolio
    VaR.SE(edhec, clean="boudt", portfolio_method="component")

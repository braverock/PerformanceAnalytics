\arguments{
\item{R}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
asset returns}

\item{Rf}{risk free rate, in same period as your returns}

\item{main}{set the chart title, same as in \code{plot}}

\item{add.names}{plots the row name with the data point.  default TRUE. Can
be removed by setting it to NULL}

\item{xlab}{set the x-axis label, as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{ylab}{set the y-axis label, as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{method}{if set as "calc", then the function will calculate values from
the set of returns passed in.  If method is set to "nocalc" then we assume
that R is a column of return and a column of risk (e.g., annualized returns,
annualized risk), in that order.  Other method cases may be set for
different risk/return calculations.}

\item{geometric}{utilize geometric chaining (TRUE) or simple/arithmetic chaining (FALSE) to aggregate returns,
default TRUE}

\item{scale}{number of periods in a year (daily scale = 252, monthly scale =
12, quarterly scale = 4)}

\item{add.sharpe}{this draws a Sharpe ratio line that indicates Sharpe ratio
levels of \code{c(1,2,3)}.  Lines are drawn with a y-intercept of the risk
free rate and the slope of the appropriate Sharpe ratio level.  Lines should
be removed where not appropriate (e.g., sharpe.ratio = NULL).}

\item{add.boxplots}{TRUE/FALSE adds a boxplot summary of the data on the
axis}

\item{colorset}{color palette to use, set by default to rational choices}

\item{symbolset}{from \code{pch} in \code{\link{plot}}, submit a set of
symbols to be used in the same order as the data sets submitted}

\item{element.color}{provides the color for drawing chart elements, such as
the box lines, axis lines, etc. Default is "darkgray"}

\item{legend.loc}{places a legend into one of nine locations on the chart:
bottomright, bottom, bottomleft, left, topleft, top, topright, right, or
center.}

\item{xlim}{set the x-axis limit, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{ylim}{set the y-axis limit, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{cex.legend}{The magnification to be used for sizing the legend
relative to the current setting of 'cex'.}

\item{cex.axis}{The magnification to be used for axis annotation relative to
the current setting of 'cex', same as in \code{\link{plot}}.}

\item{cex.main}{The magnification to be used for sizing the title relative
to the current setting of 'cex'.}

\item{cex.lab}{The magnification to be used for x and y labels relative to
the current setting of 'cex'.}

\item{\dots}{any other passthru parameters to \code{plot}}
}
\description{
A wrapper to create a scatter chart of annualized returns versus annualized
risk (standard deviation) for comparing manager performance. Also puts a box
plot into the margins to help identify the relative performance quartile.

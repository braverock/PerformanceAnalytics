\title{calculate the Hurst Index
The Hurst index can be used to measure whether returns are mean reverting,
totally random, or persistent.}
\usage{
HurstIndex(R, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of asset returns}

\item{\dots}{any other passthru parameters}
}
\description{
Hurst obtained a dimensionless statistical exponent by dividing the range 
by the standard deviation of the observations, 
so this approach is commonly referred to as rescaled range (R/S) analysis.

\details{
\deqn{H = log(m)/log(n)} 

where
\eqn{m = [max(r_i) - min(r_i)]/sigma_p} and
\eqn{n = number of observations}
A Hurst index between 0.5 and 1 suggests that the returns are persistent.
At 0.5, the index suggests returns are totally random.  Between 0 and 0.5
it suggests that the returns are mean reverting.

H.E. Hurst originally developed the Hurst index to help establish optimal
water storage along the Nile.  Nile floods are extremely persistent,
measuring a Hurst index of 0.9.  Peters (1991) notes that Equity markets 
have a Hurst index in excess of 0.5, with typical values of around 0.7.
That appears to be anomalous in the context of the mainstream 'rational 
behaviour' theories of economics, and suggests existence of a powerful
'long-term memory' causal dependence.  Clarkson (2001) suggests that an
'over-reaction bias' could be expected to generate a powerful 'long-term
memory' effect in share prices.

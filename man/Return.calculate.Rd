\title{calculate simple or compound returns from prices}
\usage{
Return.calculate(prices, method = c("discrete", "log", "difference"))

CalculateReturns(prices, method = c("discrete", "log"))
}
\arguments{
\item{prices}{data object containing ordered price observations}

\item{method}{calculate "discrete" or "log" returns, default discrete(simple)}
}
\description{
calculate simple or compound returns from prices
}
\details{
Two requirements should be made clear.  First, the function
\code{Return.calculate} assumes regular price data.  In the example, we
downloaded monthly close prices.  Prices can be for any time scale, such as
daily, weekly, monthly or annual, as long as the data consists of regular
observations.  Irregular observations require time period scaling to be
comparable.  Fortunately, \code{\link[xts]{to.period}} in the \code{xts}
package, or \code{\link[zoo]{aggregate.zoo}} in the \code{zoo} package
support management and conversion of irregular time series to regular time series.

Second, if corporate actions, dividends, or other adjustments such as time-
or money-weighting are to be taken into account, those calculations must be
made separately. This is a simple function that assumes fully adjusted close
prices as input.  For the IBM timeseries in the example below, dividends and
corporate actions are not contained in the "close" price series, so we end
up with "price returns" instead of "total returns".  This can lead to
significant underestimation of the return series over longer time periods.
To use adjusted returns, specify \code{quote="AdjClose"} in
\code{\link[tseries]{get.hist.quote}}, which is found in package
\code{tseries}, or use the \code{\link[quantmod]{Ad}} function.

We have changed the default arguments and settings for \code{method}
from \code{compound} and \code{simple} to \code{discrete} and \code{log} 
an \code{difference} to avoid confusion between the return type (discrete, log, difference)
and the chaining method (compound or arithmetic/simple).  In most of the rest of \code{PerformanceAnalytics},
compound and simple are used to refer to the \emph{return chaining} method which is used with the returns.
The default for this function is to use discrete returns, because most other package 
functions use compound chaining by default.  

Other \code{method} argument formulations also work for clarity and backwards compatibility:

\code{method='discrete'} has equivalent arguments \code{simple} and \code{arithmetic}

\code{method='log'} has equivalent argument \code{compound} and \code{continuous}

\code{method='difference'} has equivalent argument \code{diff}
}

\title{calculate a lower partial moment for a time series}
\usage{
lpm(R, n = 2, threshold = 0, about_mean = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{xts data}

\item{n}{the n-th moment to return}

\item{threshold}{threshold can be the mean or any point as desired}

\item{about_mean}{TRUE/FALSE calculate LPM about the mean under the threshold or use the threshold to calculate the LPM around (if FALSE)}
}
\description{
Caclulate a Lower Partial Moment around the mean or a specified threshold.
}
\details{
Lower partial moments capture negative deviation from a reference point.  
That reference point may be the mean, or some specified threshold that
has other meaning for the investor.

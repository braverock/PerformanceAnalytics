\usage{
chart.RelativePerformance(
  Ra,
  Rb,
  main = "Relative Performance",
  xaxis = TRUE,
  colorset = (1:12),
  legend.loc = NULL,
  ylog = FALSE,
  elementcolor = "darkgray",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ra}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
asset returns}

\item{Rb}{return vector of the benchmark asset}

\item{main}{set the chart title, same as in \code{plot}}

\item{xaxis}{if true, draws the x axis}

\item{colorset}{color palette to use, set by default to rational choices}

\item{legend.loc}{places a legend into one of nine locations on the chart:
bottomright, bottom, bottomleft, left, topleft, top, topright, right, or
center.}

\item{ylog}{TRUE/FALSE set the y-axis to logarithmic scale, similar to
\code{\link{plot}}, default FALSE}

\item{elementcolor}{provides the color for drawing less-important chart
elements, such as the box lines, axis lines, etc. replaces \code{darken}}

\item{lty}{set the line type, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{cex.legend}{the magnification to be used for sizing the legend
relative to the current setting of 'cex'.}

\item{\dots}{any other passthru parameters}
}
\description{
Plots a time series chart that shows the ratio of the cumulative performance
for two assets at each point in time and makes periods of under- or
out-performance easier to see.
}
\details{
To show under- and out-performance through different periods of time, a time
series view is more helpful. The value of the chart is less important than
the slope of the line. If the slope is positive, the first asset (numerator)
is outperforming the second, and vice versa. May be used to look at the
returns of a fund relative to each member of the peer group and the peer
group index. Alternatively, it might be used to assess the peers
individually against an asset class or peer group index.

\description{
Calculates Value-at-Risk(VaR) for univariate, component, and marginal cases
using a variety of analytical methods.
}
\note{
The option to \code{invert} the VaR measure should appease both
academics and practitioners.  The mathematical definition of VaR as the
negative value of a quantile will (usually) produce a positive number.
Practitioners will argue that VaR denotes a loss, and should be internally
consistent with the quantile (a negative number).  For tables and charts,
different preferences may apply for clarity and compactness.  As such, we
provide the option, and set the default to TRUE to keep the return
consistent with prior versions of PerformanceAnalytics, but make no value
judgment on which approach is preferable.

The prototype of the univariate Cornish Fisher VaR function was completed by
Prof. Diethelm Wuertz.  All corrections to the calculation and error
handling are the fault of Brian Peterson.

\section{Background }{


This function provides several estimation methods for
the Value at Risk (typically written as VaR) of a return series and the
Component VaR of a portfolio. Take care to capitalize VaR in the commonly
accepted manner, to avoid confusion with var (variance) and VAR (vector
auto-regression).  VaR is an industry standard for measuring downside risk.
For a return series, VaR is defined as the high quantile (e.g. ~a 95% or 99%
quantile) of the negative value of the returns. This quantile needs to be
estimated.  With a sufficiently large data set, you may choose to utilize
the empirical quantile calculated using \code{\link{quantile}}.  More
efficient estimates of VaR are obtained if a (correct) assumption is made on
the return distribution, such as the normal distribution.  If your return
series is skewed and/or has excess kurtosis, Cornish-Fisher estimates of VaR
can be more appropriate.  For the VaR of a portfolio, it is also of interest
to decompose total portfolio VaR into the risk contributions of each of the
portfolio components.  For the above mentioned VaR estimators, such a
decomposition is possible in a financially meaningful way.
}

\section{Univariate VaR estimation methods }{


The VaR at a probability level \eqn{p} (e.g. 95\%) is the \eqn{p}-quantile of
the negative returns, or equivalently, is the negative value of the
\eqn{c=1-p} quantile of the returns. In a set of returns for which
sufficently long history exists, the per-period Value at Risk is simply the
quantile of the period negative returns :
  
  \deqn{VaR=q_{.99}}{VaR=quantile(-R,p)}

where  \eqn{q_{.99}} is the 99\% empirical quantile of the negative return series.

This method is also sometimes called \dQuote{historical VaR}, as it is by
definition \emph{ex post} analysis of the return distribution, and may be
accessed with \code{method="historical"}.

When you don't have a sufficiently long set of returns to use non-parametric
or historical VaR, or wish to more closely model an ideal distribution, it is
common to us a parmetric estimate based on the distribution. J.P. Morgan's
RiskMetrics parametric mean-VaR was published in 1994 and this methodology
for estimating parametric mean-VaR has become what most literature generally
refers to as \dQuote{VaR} and what we have implemented as \code{\link{VaR}}.
See \cite{Return to RiskMetrics: Evolution of a
Standard}\url{https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/dbb975aa-5dc2-4441-aa2d-ae34ab5f0945}.


Parametric mean-VaR does a better job of accounting for the tails of the
distribution by more precisely estimating shape of the distribution tails of
the risk quantile. The most common estimate is a normal (or Gaussian)
distribution  \eqn{R\sim N(\mu,\sigma)} for the return series. In this case,
estimation of VaR requires the mean return  \eqn{\bar{R}}, the return
distribution and the variance of the returns  \eqn{\sigma}. In the most
common case, parametric VaR is thus calculated by

\deqn{\sigma=variance(R)}{sigma=var(R)}

\deqn{VaR=-\bar{R} -  \sqrt{\sigma} \cdot z_{c} }{VaR= -mean(R) - sqrt(sigma)*qnorm(c)}

where  \eqn{z_{c}} is the  \eqn{c}-quantile of the standard normal distribution. Represented in \R by \code{qnorm(c)},
and may be accessed with \code{method="gaussian"}.

Other forms of parametric mean-VaR estimation utilize a different
distribution for the distribution of losses to better account for the
possible fat-tailed nature of downside risk. The now-archived package
\code{VaR} contained methods for simulating and estimating lognormal and
generalized Pareto distributions to overcome some of the problems with
nonparametric or parametric mean-VaR calculations on a limited sample size or
on potentially fat-tailed distributions. There was also a
VaR.backtest function to apply simulation methods to create a more robust
estimate of the potential distribution of losses. Less commonly a covariance
matrix of multiple risk factors may be applied. This functionality should 
probably be 

The limitations of mean Value-at-Risk are well covered in the literature.
The limitations of traditional mean-VaR are all related to the use of a
symetrical distribution function. Use of simulations, resampling, or Pareto
distributions all help in making a more accurate prediction, but they are
still flawed for assets with significantly non-normal (skewed or kurtotic)
distributions. Zangari (1996) and Favre and Galeano(2002) provide a modified
VaR calculation that takes the higher moments of non-normal distributions
(skewness, kurtosis) into account through the use of a Cornish Fisher
expansion, and collapses to standard (traditional) mean-VaR if the return
stream follows a standard distribution. This measure is now widely cited and
used in the literature, and is usually referred to as \dQuote{Modified VaR}
or \dQuote{Modified Cornish-Fisher VaR}. They arrive at their modified VaR
calculation in the following manner:
  
\deqn{z_{cf}=z_{c}+\frac{(z_{c}^{2}-1)S}{6}+\frac{(z_{c}^{3}-3z_{c})K}{24}-\frac{(2z_{c}^{3}-5z_{c})S^{2}}{36}}{
    z_cf=z_c+[(z_c^2-1)S]/6+[(z_c^3-3z_c)K]/24-[(2z_c^3-5z_c)S^2]/36}

\deqn{Cornish-Fisher VaR =-\bar{R} - \sqrt(\sigma) \cdot z_{cf}}{VaR= -mean(R) - sqrt(sigma)*z_cf}

where \eqn{S} is the skewness of \eqn{R} and \eqn{K} is the excess kurtosis of \eqn{R}.

Cornish-Fisher VaR collapses to traditional mean-VaR when returns are
normally distributed. As such, the \code{\link{VaR}} and \code{\link{VaR}}
functions are wrappers for the \code{VaR} function. The Cornish-Fisher
expansion also naturally encompasses much of the variability in returns that
could be uncovered by more computationally intensive techniques such as
resampling or Monte-Carlo simulation.  This is the default method for the
\code{VaR} function, and may be accessed by setting \code{method="modified"}.


Favre and Galeano also utilize modified VaR in a modified Sharpe Ratio as the
return/risk measure for their portfolio optimization analysis, see
\code{\link{SharpeRatio.modified}} for more information.
}

\section{Component VaR }{


By setting \code{portfolio_method="component"} you may calculate the risk
contribution of each element of the portfolio.  The return from the function
in this case will be a list with three components: the univariate portfolio
VaR, the scalar contribution of each component to the portfolio VaR (these
will sum to the portfolio VaR), and a percentage risk contribution (which
will sum to 100\%).

Both the numerical and percentage component contributions to VaR may contain
both positive and negative contributions.  A negative contribution to
Component VaR indicates a portfolio risk diversifier.  Increasing the
position weight will reduce overall portoflio VaR.

If a weighting vector is not passed in via \code{weights}, the function will
assume an equal weighted (neutral) portfolio.

Multiple risk decomposition approaches have been suggested in the literature. 
A naive approach is to set the risk contribution equal to the stand-alone risk.
This approach is overly simplistic and neglects important diversification
effects of the units being exposed differently to the underlying risk
factors. An alternative approach is to measure the VaR contribution as the
weight of the position in the portfolio times the partial derivative of the
portfolio VaR with respect to the component weight. \deqn{C_i \mbox{VaR} =
w_i \frac{ \partial \mbox{VaR} }{\partial w_i}.}{C[i]VaR =
w[i]*(dVaR/dw[i]).} Because the portfolio VaR is linear in position size, we
have that by Euler's theorem the portfolio VaR is the sum of these risk
contributions. Gourieroux (2000) shows that for VaR, this mathematical
decomposition of portfolio risk has a financial meaning. It equals the
negative value of the asset's expected contribution to the portfolio return
when the portfolio return equals the negative portfolio VaR:

\deqn{C_i \mbox{VaR} = = -E\left[ w_i r_{i} | r_{p} = - \mbox{VaR}\right]}{C[i]VaR = -E( w[i]r[i]|rp=-VaR ) }

For the decomposition of Gaussian VaR, the estimated mean and covariance
matrix are needed. For the decomposition of modified VaR, also estimates of
the coskewness and cokurtosis matrices are needed. If \eqn{r} denotes the
\eqn{Nx1} return vector and \eqn{mu} is the mean vector, then the \eqn{N
\times N^2} co-skewness matrix is \deqn{ m3 = E\left[ (r - \mu)(r - \mu)'
\otimes (r - \mu)'\right]}{m3 = E[ (r - mu)(r - mu)' \%x\%  (r - \mu)']} The
\eqn{N \times N^3} co-kurtosis matrix is

\deqn{ m_{4} =
  E\left[ (r - \mu)(r - \mu)' \otimes (r - \mu)'\otimes (r - \mu)'
  \right] }{E[ (r - \mu)(r - \mu)' \%x\% (r - \mu)'\%x\% (r - \mu)']}
  
where \eqn{\otimes}{\%x\%} stands for the Kronecker product. The matrices can
be estimated through the functions \code{skewness.MM} and \code{kurtosis.MM}.
More efficient estimators have been proposed by Martellini and Ziemann (2007)
and will be implemented in the future.

As discussed among others in Cont, Deguest and Scandolo (2007), it is
important that the estimation of the VaR measure is robust to single
outliers. This is especially the case for  modified VaR and its
decomposition, since they use higher order moments. By default, the portfolio
moments are estimated by their sample counterparts. If \code{clean="boudt"}
then the \eqn{1-p} most extreme observations are winsorized if they are
detected as being outliers. For more information, see Boudt, Peterson and
Croux (2008) and \code{\link{Return.clean}}.  If your data consist of returns
for highly illiquid assets, then \code{clean="geltner"} may be more
appropriate to reduce distortion caused by autocorrelation, see
\code{\link{Return.Geltner}} for details.

Epperlein and Smillie (2006) introduced a non-parametric kernel estimator for 
component risk contributions, which is available via \code{method="kernel"} 
and \code{portfolio_method="component"}.

\section{Marginal VaR }{


Different papers call this different things.  In the Denton and Jayaraman
paper referenced here, this calculation is called Incremental VaR. We have
chosen the more common usage of calling this difference in VaR's in
portfolios without the instrument and with the instrument as the
\dQuote{difference at the Margin}, thus the name Marginal VaR. This is
incredibly confusing, and hasn't been resolved in the literature at this
time.

Simon Keel and David Ardia (2009) attempt to reconcile some of the
definitional issues and address some of the shortcomings of this measure in
their working paper titled \dQuote{Generalized Marginal Risk}. Hopefully 
their improved Marginal Risk measures may be included here in the future.

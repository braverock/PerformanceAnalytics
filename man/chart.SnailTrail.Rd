}
\arguments{
\item{R}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
asset returns}

\item{Rf}{risk free rate, in same period as your returns}

\item{main}{set the chart title, same as in \code{plot}}

\item{add.names}{plots the row name with the data point.  default TRUE. Can
be removed by setting it to NULL}

\item{xlab}{set the x-axis label, as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{ylab}{set the y-axis label, as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{add.sharpe}{this draws a Sharpe ratio line that indicates Sharpe ratio
levels of \code{c(1,2,3)}.  Lines are drawn with a y-intercept of the risk
free rate and the slope of the appropriate Sharpe ratio level.  Lines should
be removed where not appropriate (e.g., sharpe.ratio = NULL).}

\item{colorset}{color palette to use, set by default to rational choices}

\item{symbolset}{from \code{pch} in \code{\link{plot}}, submit a set of
symbols to be used in the same order as the data sets submitted}

\item{legend.loc}{places a legend into one of nine locations on the chart:
bottomright, bottom, bottomleft, left, topleft, top, topright, right, or
center.}

\item{xlim}{set the x-axis limit, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{ylim}{set the y-axis limit, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{width}{number of periods to apply rolling calculations over, sometimes
referred to as a 'window'}

\item{stepsize}{the frequency with which to make the rolling calculation}

\item{lty}{set the line type, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{lwd}{set the line width, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{cex.axis}{The magnification to be used for sizing the axis text
relative to the current setting of 'cex', similar to \code{\link{plot}}.}

\item{cex.main}{The magnification to be used for sizing the main chart
relative to the current setting of 'cex', as in \code{\link{plot}}.}

\item{cex.lab}{The magnification to be used for sizing the label relative to
the current setting of 'cex', similar to \code{\link{plot}}.}

\item{cex.text}{The magnification to be used for sizing the text relative to
the current setting of 'cex', similar to \code{\link{plot}}.}

\item{cex.legend}{The magnification to be used for sizing the legend
relative to the current setting of 'cex'.}

\item{element.color}{provides the color for drawing chart elements, such as
the box lines, axis lines, etc. Default is "darkgray"}

\item{\dots}{any other passthru parameters}
}
\description{
A chart that shows rolling calculations of annualized return and annualized
standard deviation have proceeded through time.  Lines and dots are darker
for more recent time periods.

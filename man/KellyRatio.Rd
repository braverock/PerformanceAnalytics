\title{calculate Kelly criterion ratio (leverage or bet size) for a strategy}
\usage{
KellyRatio(R, Rf = 0, method = "half")
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{a vector of returns to perform a mean over}

\item{Rf}{risk free rate, in same period as your returns}

\item{method}{method=half will use the half-Kelly, this is the default}
}
\description{
Kelly criterion ratio (leverage or bet size) for a strategy.
}
\details{
The Kelly Criterion was identified by Bell Labs scientist John Kelly, and
applied to blackjack and stock strategy sizing by Ed Thorpe.

The Kelly ratio can be simply stated as: \dQuote{bet size is the ratio of
edge over odds.} Mathematically, you are maximizing log-utility.  As such,
the Kelly criterion is equal to the expected excess return of the strategy
divided by the expected variance of the excess return, or

\deqn{leverage=\frac{(\overline{R}_{s}-R_{f})}{StdDev(R)^{2}}}{leverage =
(mean(R)-Rf=0)/StdDev(R)^2}

As a performance metric, the Kelly Ratio is calculated retrospectively on a
particular investment as a measure of the edge that investment has over the
risk free rate.  It may be use as a stack ranking method to compare
investments in a manner similar to the various ratios related to the Sharpe
ratio.

    data(managers)
    KellyRatio(managers[,1,drop=FALSE], Rf=.04/12)
    KellyRatio(managers[,1,drop=FALSE], Rf=managers[,10,drop=FALSE])
    KellyRatio(managers[,1:6], Rf=managers[,10,drop=FALSE])

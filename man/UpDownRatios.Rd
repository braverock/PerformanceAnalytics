\title{calculate metrics on up and down markets for the benchmark asset}
\usage{
UpDownRatios(Ra, Rb, method = c("Capture", "Number", "Percent"),
  side = c("Up", "Down"))
}
\arguments{
\item{Ra}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
asset returns}

\item{Rb}{return vector of the benchmark asset}

\item{method}{"Capture", "Number", or "Percent" to indicate which measure to
return}

\item{side}{"Up" or "Down" market statistics}
}
\description{
Calculate metrics on how the asset in R performed in up and down markets,
measured by periods when the benchmark asset was up or down.
}
\details{
This is a function designed to calculate several related metrics:

Up (Down) Capture Ratio: this is a measure of an investment's compound
return when the benchmark was up (down) divided by the benchmark's compound
return when the benchmark was up (down). The greater (lower) the value, the
better.

Up (Down) Number Ratio: similarly, this is a measure of the number of
periods that the investment was up (down) when the benchmark was up (down),
divided by the number of periods that the Benchmark was up (down).

Up (Down) Percentage Ratio: this is a measure of the number of periods that
the investment outperformed the benchmark when the benchmark was up (down),
divided by the number of periods that the benchmark was up (down). Unlike
the prior two metrics, in both cases a higher value is better.

data(managers)
UpDownRatios(managers[,1, drop=FALSE], managers[,8, drop=FALSE])
UpDownRatios(managers[,1:6, drop=FALSE], managers[,8, drop=FALSE])
UpDownRatios(managers[,1, drop=FALSE], managers[,8, drop=FALSE], method="Capture")
# Up Capture:
UpDownRatios(managers[,1, drop=FALSE], managers[,8, drop=FALSE], side="Up", method="Capture")
# Down Capture:
UpDownRatios(managers[,1, drop=FALSE], managers[,8, drop=FALSE], side="Down", method="Capture")

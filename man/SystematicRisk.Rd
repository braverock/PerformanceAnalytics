\title{Systematic risk of the return distribution}
\usage{
SystematicRisk(Ra, Rb, Rf = 0, scale = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ra}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
asset returns}

\item{Rb}{return vector of the benchmark asset}

\item{Rf}{risk free rate, in same period as your returns}

\item{scale}{number of periods in a year (daily scale = 252, monthly scale =
12, quarterly scale = 4)}

\item{\dots}{any other passthru parameters}
}
\description{
Systematic risk as defined by Bacon(2008) is the product of beta by market 
risk. Be careful ! It's not the same definition as the one given by Michael
Jensen. Market risk is the standard deviation of the benchmark. The systematic
risk is annualized
}
\details{
\deqn{\sigma_s = \beta * \sigma_m}{systematic risk = beta * market risk}

where \eqn{\sigma_s} is the systematic risk, \eqn{\beta} is the regression beta,
and \eqn{\sigma_m} is the market risk
}
\examples{

data(portfolio_bacon)
print(SystematicRisk(portfolio_bacon[,1], portfolio_bacon[,2])) #expected 0.013

data(managers)
print(SystematicRisk(managers['1996',1], managers['1996',8]))
print(SystematicRisk(managers['1996',1:5], managers['1996',8]))

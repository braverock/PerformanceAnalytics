\title{d ratio of the return distribution}
\usage{
DRatio(R, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
asset returns}

\item{\dots}{any other passthru parameters}
}
\description{
The d ratio is similar to the Bernado Ledoit ratio but inverted and
taking into account the frequency of positive and negative returns.
}
\details{
It has values between zero and infinity. It can be used to rank the 
performance of portfolios. The lower the d ratio the better the 
performance, a value of zero indicating there are no returns less than
zero and a value of infinity indicating there are no returns greater than zero.

\deqn{DRatio(R) = \frac{n_{d}*\sum^{n}_{t=1}{max(-R_{t},0)}}{n_{u}*\sum^{n}_{t=1}
{max(R_{t},0)}}}{DRatio(R) = nd*sum
(t=1..n)(max(-R(t),0)) / nu*sum(t=1..n)(max(R(t),0))}

where \eqn{n} is the number of observations of the entire series,
      \eqn{n_{d}} is the number of observations less than zero,
      \eqn{n_{u}} is the number of observations greater than zero

data(portfolio_bacon)
print(DRatio(portfolio_bacon[,1])) #expected 0.401

data(managers)
print(DRatio(managers['1996']))
print(DRatio(managers['1996',1])) #expected 0.0725

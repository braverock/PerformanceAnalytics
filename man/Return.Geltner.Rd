\title{calculate Geltner liquidity-adjusted return series}
\usage{
Return.Geltner(Ra, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ra}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
asset returns}

\item{\dots}{any other passthru parameters}
}
\description{
David Geltner developed a method to remove estimating or liquidity bias in
real estate index returns.  It has since been applied with success to other
return series that show autocorrelation or illiquidity effects.
}
\details{
The theory is that by correcting for autocorrelation, you are uncovering a
"true" return from a series of observed returns that contain illiquidity or
manual pricing effects.

The Geltner autocorrelation adjusted return series may be calculated via:

\deqn{ }{Geltner.returns = [R(t) - R(t-1)*acf(R(t-1))]/1-acf(R(t-1)) }\deqn{
R_{G}=\frac{R_{t}-(R_{t-1}\cdot\rho_{1})}{1-\rho_{1}} }{Geltner.returns =
[R(t) - R(t-1)*acf(R(t-1))]/1-acf(R(t-1)) }

where \eqn{\rho_{1}}{acf(R(t-1))} is the first-order autocorrelation of the
return series \eqn{R_{a}}{Ra} and \eqn{R_{t}}{R(t)} is the return of
\eqn{R_{a}}{Ra} at time \eqn{t} and \eqn{R_{t-1}}{R(t-1)} is the one-period
lagged return.

\title{Takes a set of returns and relates them to a market benchmark in a
scatterplot}
\usage{
chart.Regression(Ra, Rb, Rf = 0, excess.returns = FALSE,
  reference.grid = TRUE, main = "Title", ylab = NULL, xlab = NULL,
  xlim = NA, colorset = 1:12, symbolset = 1:12,
  element.color = "darkgray", legend.loc = NULL, ylog = FALSE,
  fit = c("loess", "linear", "conditional", "quadratic"), span = 2/3,

}
\arguments{
\item{Ra}{a vector of returns to test, e.g., the asset to be examined}

\item{Rb}{a matrix, data.frame, or timeSeries of benchmark(s) to test the
asset against}

\item{Rf}{risk free rate, in same period as the returns}

\item{excess.returns}{logical; should excess returns be used?}

\item{reference.grid}{if true, draws a grid aligned with the points on the x
and y axes}

\item{main}{set the chart title, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{ylab}{set the y-axis title, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{xlab}{set the x-axis title, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{xlim}{set the x-axis limit, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{colorset}{color palette to use}

\item{symbolset}{symbols to use, see also 'pch' in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{element.color}{provides the color for drawing chart elements, such as
the box lines, axis lines, etc. Default is "darkgray"}

\item{legend.loc}{places a legend into one of nine locations on the chart:
bottomright, bottom, bottomleft, left, topleft, top, topright, right, or
center.}

\item{ylog}{Not used}

\item{fit}{for values of "loess", "linear", or "conditional", plots a line
to fit the data.  Conditional lines are drawn separately for positive and
negative benchmark returns.  "Quadratic" is not yet implemented.}

\item{span}{passed to loess line fit, as in \code{\link{loess.smooth}}}

\item{degree}{passed to loess line fit, as in \code{\link{loess.smooth}}}

\item{family}{passed to loess line fit, as in \code{\link{loess.smooth}}}

\item{ylim}{set the y-axis limit, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{evaluation}{passed to loess line fit, as in \code{\link{loess.smooth}}}

\item{legend.cex}{set the legend size}

\item{cex}{set the cex size, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{lwd}{set the line width for fits, same as in \code{\link{lines}}}

\item{\dots}{any other passthru parameters to \code{\link{plot}}}
}
\description{
Uses a scatterplot to display the relationship of a set of returns to a
market benchmark.  Fits a linear model and overlays the resulting model.
Also overlays a Loess line for comparison.

data(managers)
chart.Regression(managers[, 1:2, drop = FALSE], 
		managers[, 8, drop = FALSE], 
		Rf = managers[, 10, drop = FALSE], 
		excess.returns = TRUE, fit = c("loess", "linear"), 
		legend.loc = "topleft")

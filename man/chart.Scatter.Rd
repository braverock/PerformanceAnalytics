\title{wrapper to draw scatter plot with sensible defaults}
\usage{
chart.Scatter(x, y, reference.grid = TRUE, main = "Title", ylab = NULL,
  xlab = NULL, xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, colorset = 1, symbolset = 1,
  element.color = "darkgray", cex.axis = 0.8, cex.legend = 0.8,
  cex.lab = 1, cex.main = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data for the x axis, can take matrix,vector, or timeseries}

\item{y}{data for the y axis, can take matrix,vector, or timeseries}

\item{reference.grid}{if true, draws a grid aligned with the points on the x
and y axes}

\item{main}{set the chart title, same as in \code{plot}}

\item{ylab}{set the y-axis label, as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{xlab}{set the x-axis label, as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{xlim}{set the x-axis limit, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{ylim}{set the y-axis limit, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{colorset}{color palette to use, set by default to rational choices}

\item{symbolset}{from \code{pch} in \code{\link{plot}}, submit a set of
symbols to be used in the same order as the data sets submitted}

\item{element.color}{provides the color for drawing chart elements, such as
the box lines, axis lines, etc. Default is "darkgray"}

\item{cex.axis}{The magnification to be used for axis annotation relative to
the current setting of 'cex', same as in \code{\link{plot}}.}

\item{cex.legend}{The magnification to be used for sizing the legend
relative to the current setting of 'cex'.}

\item{cex.lab}{The magnification to be used for x- and y-axis labels
relative to the current setting of 'cex'}

\item{cex.main}{The magnification to be used for the main title relative to
the current setting of 'cex'.}

\item{\dots}{any other passthru parameters}
}
\description{
Draws a scatter chart.  This is another chart "primitive", since it only
contains a set of sensible defaults.
}
\note{
Most inputs are the same as "\code{\link{plot}}" and are principally
included so that some sensible defaults could be set.

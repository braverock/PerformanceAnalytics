\description{
The pain index is the mean value of the drawdowns over the entire 
analysis period. The measure is similar to the Ulcer index except that 
the drawdowns are not squared.  Also, it's different than the average
drawdown, in that the numerator is the total number of observations 
rather than the number of drawdowns.
}
\details{
Visually, the pain index is the area of the region that is enclosed by 
the horizontal line at zero percent and the drawdown line in the 
Drawdown chart.

\deqn{Pain index = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \frac{\mid D'_i \mid}{n}}{Pain index = sum(|D'i|/n)}

where \eqn{n} is the number of observations of the entire series, \eqn{D'_i} is
the drawdown since previous peak in period i

data(portfolio_bacon)
print(PainIndex(portfolio_bacon[,1])) #expected 0.04

data(managers)
print(PainIndex(100*managers['1996']))
print(PainIndex(100*managers['1996',1]))

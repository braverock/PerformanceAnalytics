\description{
Robustly clean a time series to reduce the magnitude, but not the number or
direction, of observations that exceed the \eqn{1-\alpha\%} risk threshold.
}
\details{
Many risk measures are calculated by using the first two (four) moments of
the asset or portfolio return distribution. Portfolio moments are extremely
sensitive to data spikes, and this sensitivity is only exacerbated in a
multivariate context. For this reason, it seems appropriate to consider
estimates of the multivariate moments that are robust to return observations
that deviate extremely from the Gaussian distribution.

There are two main approaches in defining robust alternatives to estimate
the multivariate moments by their sample means (see e.g. Maronna[2006]). One
approach is to consider a more robust estimator than the sample means.
Another one is to first clean (in a robust way) the data and then take the
sample means and moments of the cleaned data.

Our cleaning method follows the second approach. It is designed in such a
way that, if we want to estimate downside risk with loss probability
\eqn{\alpha}{alpha}, it will never clean observations that belong to the
\eqn{1-\alpha}{(1-alpha)} least extreme observations. Suppose we have an
\eqn{n}-dimensional vector time series of length \eqn{T}: \eqn{r_1,...,r_T}.
We clean this time series in three steps.

\enumerate{ \item \emph{ Ranking the observations in function of their
extremeness. }Denote \eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\Sigma} the mean and covariance
matrix of the bulk of the data and let \eqn{\lfloor \cdot \rfloor}{floor()}
be the operator that takes the integer part of its argument. As a measure of
the extremeness of the return observation \eqn{r_t}, we use its squared
Mahalanobis distance \eqn{ d^2_t = (r_t-\mu)'\Sigma^{-1}(r_t-\mu)}.  We
follow Rousseeuw(1985) by estimating \eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\Sigma} as the mean
vector and covariance matrix (corrected to ensure consistency) of the subset
of size \eqn{\lfloor (1-\alpha)T\rfloor}{floor((1-\alpha)T)} for which the
determinant of the covariance matrix of the elements in that subset is the
smallest. These estimates will be robust against the \eqn{\alpha} most
extreme returns. Let \eqn{d^2_{(1)},...,d^2_{(T)}} be the ordered sequence
of the estimated squared Mahalanobis distances such that \eqn{d^2_{(i)}\leq
d^2_{(i+1)}}.

\item \emph{Outlier identification.} Return observations are qualified as
outliers if their estimated squared Mahalanobis distance \eqn{d^2_t} is
greater than the empirical \eqn{1-\alpha} quantile \eqn{d^2_{(\lfloor
(1-\alpha)T \rfloor)}}{floor((1-\alpha)T)} and exceeds a very extreme
quantile of the Chi squared distribution function with \eqn{n} degrees of
freedom, which is the distribution function of \eqn{d^2_t} when the returns
are normally distributed. In this application we take the 99.9\% quantile,
denoted \eqn{\chi ^2_{n,0.999}}.

\item \emph{Data cleaning. } Similarly to Khan(2007) we only clean the
returns that are identified as outliers in step 2 
by replacing these returns \eqn{r_t} with 
\deqn{r_t\sqrt{\frac{\max(d^2_{(\lfloor(1-\alpha)T)\rfloor},\chi^2_{n,0.999})}{d^2_t}}}{r_t * sqrt(max(d^2_floor((1-\alpha)T),\chi^2_{n,0.999})/d^2_t)}
The cleaned
return vector has the same orientation as the original return vector, but
its magnitude is smaller. Khan(2007) calls this procedure of limiting the
value of \eqn{d^2_t} to a quantile of the \eqn{\chi^2_n} distribution,
``multivariate Winsorization'.

}

Note that the primary value of data cleaning lies in creating a more robust
and stable estimation of the distribution describing the large majority of
the return data. The increased robustness and stability of the estimated
moments utilizing cleaned data should be used for portfolio construction. If
a portfolio manager wishes to have a more conservative risk estimate,
cleaning may not be indicated for risk monitoring. It is also important to
note that the robust method proposed here does not remove data from the
series, but only decreases the magnitude of the extreme events. It may also
be appropriate in practice to use a cleaning threshold somewhat outside the
VaR threshold that the manager wishes to consider. In actual practice, it is
probably best to back-test the results of both cleaned and uncleaned series
to see what works best with the particular combination of assets under
consideration.

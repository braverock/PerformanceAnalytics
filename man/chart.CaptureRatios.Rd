\usage{
chart.CaptureRatios(Ra, Rb, main = "Capture Ratio", add.names = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{Ra}{Returns to test, e.g., the asset to be examined}

\item{Rb}{Returns of a benchmark to compare the asset with}

\item{main}{Set the chart title, same as in \code{plot}}

\item{add.names}{Plots the row name with the data point.  Default TRUE. Can
be removed by setting it to NULL}

\item{xlab}{Set the x-axis label, as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{ylab}{Set the y-axis label, as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{colorset}{Color palette to use, set by default to "black"}

\item{symbolset}{From \code{pch} in \code{\link{plot}}. Submit a set of
symbols to be used in the same order as the data sets submitted}

\item{legend.loc}{Places a legend into one of nine locations on the chart:
bottomright, bottom, bottomleft, left, topleft, top, topright, right, or
center.}

\item{xlim}{set the x-axis limit, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{ylim}{set the y-axis limit, same as in \code{\link{plot}}}

\item{cex.legend}{The magnification to be used for sizing the legend
relative to the current setting of 'cex'.}

\item{cex.axis}{The magnification to be used for axis annotation relative to
the current setting of 'cex', same as in \code{\link{plot}}.}

\item{cex.main}{The magnification to be used for sizing the title relative
to the current setting of 'cex'.}

\item{cex.lab}{The magnification to be used for x and y labels relative to
the current setting of 'cex'.}

\item{element.color}{Specify the color of the box, axes, and other chart
elements.  Default is "darkgray"}

\item{benchmark.color}{Specify the color of the benchmark reference and
crosshairs.  Default is "darkgray"}

\item{\dots}{Any other passthru parameters to \code{plot}}

\description{
Scatter plot of Up Capture versus Down Capture against a benchmark
}
\details{
Scatter plot shows the coordinates of each set of returns' Up and Down
Capture against a benchmark.  The benchmark value is by definition plotted
at (1,1) with solid crosshairs.  A diagonal dashed line with slope equal to
1 divides the plot into two regions: above that line the UpCapture exceeds
the DownCapture, and vice versa.

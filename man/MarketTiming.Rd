\usage{
MarketTiming(Ra, Rb, Rf = 0, method = c("TM", "HM"))
}
\arguments{
\item{Ra}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
the asset returns}

\item{Rb}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of 
the benchmark asset return}

\item{Rf}{risk free rate, in same period as your returns}

\item{method}{used to select between Treynor-Mazuy and Henriksson-Merton
models. May be any of: \itemize{ \item TM - Treynor-Mazuy model, 
\item HM - Henriksson-Merton model} By default Treynor-Mazuy is selected}

\item{\dots}{any other passthrough parameters}
}
\description{
Allows to estimate Treynor-Mazuy or Merton-Henriksson market timing model.
The Treynor-Mazuy model is essentially a quadratic extension of the basic
CAPM. It is estimated using a multiple regression. The second term in the
regression is the value of excess return squared. If the gamma coefficient
in the regression is positive, then the estimated equation describes a 
convex upward-sloping regression "line". The quadratic regression is:
\deqn{R_{p}-R_{f}=\alpha+\beta (R_{b} - R_{f})+\gamma (R_{b}-R_{f})^2+
\varepsilon_{p}}{Rp - Rf = alpha + beta(Rb -Rf) + gamma(Rb - Rf)^2 + 
epsilonp}
\eqn{\gamma}{gamma} is a measure of the curvature of the regression line.
If \eqn{\gamma}{gamma} is positive, this would indicate that the manager's
investment strategy demonstrates market timing ability.
}
\details{
The basic idea of the Merton-Henriksson test is to perform a multiple 
regression in which the dependent variable (portfolio excess return and a 
second variable that mimics the payoff to an option). This second variable 
is zero when the market excess return is at or below zero and is 1 when it 
is above zero:
\deqn{R_{p}-R_{f}=\alpha+\beta (R_{b}-R_{f})+\gamma D+\varepsilon_{p}}{Rp - 
Rf = alpha + beta * (Rb - Rf) + gamma * D + epsilonp}
where all variables are familiar from the CAPM model, except for the 
up-market return \eqn{D=max(0,R_{b}-R_{f})}{D = max(0, Rb - Rf)} and market 
timing abilities \eqn{\gamma}{gamma}

\description{
Calculates Expected Shortfall(ES) (also known as) Conditional Value at
Risk(CVaR) or Expected Tail Loss (ETL) for univariate, component, 
and marginal cases using a variety of analytical methods.
}
\note{
The option to \code{invert} the ES measure should appease both
academics and practitioners.  The mathematical definition of ES as the
negative value of extreme losses will (usually) produce a positive number.
Practitioners will argue that ES denotes a loss, and should be internally
consistent with the quantile (a negative number).  For tables and charts,
different preferences may apply for clarity and compactness.  As such, we
provide the option, and set the default to TRUE to keep the return
consistent with prior versions of PerformanceAnalytics, but make no value
judgement on which approach is preferable.

\section{Background}{
 

This function provides several estimation methods for
the Expected Shortfall (ES) (also called Expected Tail Loss (ETL)
or Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)) of a return series and the Component ES
(ETL/CVaR) of a portfolio.

At a preset probability level denoted \eqn{c}, which typically is between 1
and 5 per cent, the ES of a return series is the negative value of the
expected value of the return when the return is less than its
\eqn{c}-quantile.  Unlike value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk has all
the properties a risk measure should have to be coherent and is a convex
function of the portfolio weights (Pflug, 2000).  With a sufficiently large
data set, you may choose to estimate ES with the sample average of all
returns that are below the \eqn{c} empirical quantile. More efficient
estimates of VaR are obtained if a (correct) assumption is made on the
return distribution, such as the normal distribution. If your return series
is skewed and/or has excess kurtosis, Cornish-Fisher estimates of ES can be
more appropriate. For the ES of a portfolio, it is also of interest to
decompose total portfolio ES into the risk contributions of each of the
portfolio components. For the above mentioned ES estimators, such a
decomposition is possible in a financially meaningful way.
}

\section{Univariate estimation of ES}{


The ES at a probability level \eqn{p} (e.g. 95\%) is  the negative value of
the expected value of the return when the return is less than its
\eqn{c=1-p} quantile. In a set of returns for which sufficently long history
exists, the per-period ES can be estimated by the negative value of the
sample average of all returns below the quantile. This method is also
sometimes called \dQuote{historical ES}, as it is by definition \emph{ex
post} analysis of the return distribution, and may be accessed with
\code{method="historical"}.

When you don't have a sufficiently long set of returns to use non-parametric
or historical ES, or wish to more closely model an ideal distribution, it is
common to us a parmetric estimate based on the distribution. Parametric ES
does a better job of accounting for the tails of the distribution by more
precisely estimating shape of the distribution tails of the risk quantile.
The most common estimate is a normal (or Gaussian) distribution  \eqn{R\sim
N(\mu,\sigma)} for the return series. In this case, estimation of ES requires
the mean return  \eqn{\bar{R}}, the return distribution and the variance of
the returns  \eqn{\sigma}. In the most common case, parametric VaR is thus
calculated by

\deqn{\sigma=variance(R)}{sigma=var(R)}

\deqn{ES=-\bar{R} + \sqrt{\sigma} \cdot \frac{1}{c}\phi(z_{c}) }{VaR= -mean(R) + sqrt(sigma)*dnorm(z_c)/c}

where  \eqn{z_{c}} is the  \eqn{c}-quantile of the standard normal
distribution. Represented in \R by \code{qnorm(c)}, and may be accessed with
\code{method="gaussian"}. The function \eqn{\phi}{dnorm} is the Gaussian
density function.


The limitations of Gaussian ES are well covered in the literature, since most
financial return series are non-normal. Boudt, Peterson and Croux (2008)
provide a modified ES calculation that takes the higher moments of non-normal
distributions (skewness, kurtosis) into account through the use of a
Cornish-Fisher expansion, and collapses to standard (traditional) Gaussian ES
if the return stream follows a standard distribution. More precisely, for a
loss probability \eqn{c}, modified ES is defined as the negative of the
expected value of all returns below the \eqn{c} Cornish-Fisher quantile and
where the expectation is computed under the second order Edgeworth expansion
of the true distribution function.

Modified expected shortfall should always be larger than modified Value at
Risk. Due to estimation problems, this might not always be the case. Set
Operational = TRUE to replace modified ES with modified VaR in the
(exceptional) case where the modified ES is smaller than modified VaR.

\examples{

    data(edhec)

    # first do normal ES calc
    ES(edhec, p=.95, method="historical")

    # now use Gaussian
    ES(edhec, p=.95, method="gaussian")

    # now use modified Cornish Fisher calc to take non-normal distribution into account
    ES(edhec, p=.95, method="modified")

    # now use p=.99
    ES(edhec, p=.99)
    # or the equivalent alpha=.01
    ES(edhec, p=.01)

    # now with outliers squished
    ES(edhec, clean="boudt")

    # add Component ES for the equal weighted portfolio
    ES(edhec, clean="boudt", portfolio_method="component")

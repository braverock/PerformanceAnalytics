\arguments{
\item{R}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
asset returns}

\item{L}{L is the loss threshold that can be specified as zero, return from
a benchmark index, or an absolute rate of return - any specified level}

\item{method}{one of: simple, interp, binomial, blackscholes}

\item{output}{one of: point (in time), or full (distribution of Omega)}

\item{Rf}{risk free rate, as a single number}

\item{SE}{TRUE/FALSE whether to ouput the standard errors of the estimates of the risk measures, default FALSE.}

\item{SE.control}{Control parameters for the computation of standard errors. Should be done using the \code{\link{RPESE.control}} function.}

\item{\dots}{any other passthru parameters}

\description{
Keating and Shadwick (2002) proposed Omega (referred to as Gamma in their
original paper) as a way to capture all of the higher moments of the returns
distribution.

\details{
Mathematically, Omega is: integral[L to b](1 - F(r))dr / integral[a to
L](F(r))dr

where the cumulative distribution F is defined on the interval (a,b). L is
the loss threshold that can be specified as zero, return from a benchmark
index, or an absolute rate of return - any specified level. When comparing
alternatives using Omega, L should be common.

Input data can be transformed prior to calculation, which may be useful for
introducing risk aversion.

This function returns a vector of Omega, useful for plotting.  The steeper,
the less risky.  Above it's mean, a steeply sloped Omega also implies a very
limited potential for further gain.

Omega has a value of 1 at the mean of the distribution.

Omega is sub-additive.  The ratio is dimensionless.

Kazemi, Schneeweis, and Gupta (2003), in "Omega as a Performance Measure"
show that Omega can be written as: Omega(L) = C(L)/P(L) where C(L) is
essentially the price of a European call option written on the investment
and P(L) is essentially the price of a European put option written on the
investment.  The maturity for both options is one period (e.g., one month)
and L is the strike price of both options.

The numerator and the denominator can be expressed as: exp(-Rf=0) * E[max(x
- L, 0)] exp(-Rf=0) * E[max(L - x, 0)] with exp(-Rf=0) calculating the
present values of the two, where rf is the per-period riskless rate.

The first three methods implemented here focus on that observation. The
first method takes the simplification described above.  The second uses the
Black-Scholes option pricing as implemented in fOptions.  The third uses the
binomial pricing model from fOptions.  The second and third methods are not
implemented here.

The fourth method, "interp", creates a linear interpolation of the cdf of
returns, calculates Omega as a vector, and finally interpolates a function
for Omega as a function of L.  This method requires library \code{Hmisc},
which can be found on CRAN.
